# Kroger Store Optimization

The primary objective of this project is to develop a simulation model for a Kroger store, focusing on the observation and analysis of customer arrivals, shopping durations, and checkout processes over a one-hour busy period. The simulation will be implemented using Arena software, with the aim of conducting 20¬†replications to provide statistically significant insights into store performance.
Additionally, this simulation will aid in analyzing and optimizing the store's operational efficiency by studying factors such as staffing levels, checkout counter allocation, and customer flow management.

The results show that the wait times are almost negligible, and the resources are under-utilized. From a business perspective, this translates to a lot of opportunity for generating overall cost savings and hence the simulation has been performed for different scenarios with reduced resources.
